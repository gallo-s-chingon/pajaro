  <summary><i>whats with Tickets</i></summary>
  <b>Presale tickets are available for purchase on our website via our ticketing partner eventbrite. service and miscellaneous fees may apply on presale tickets they don't give me too many details, but I do know when I've bought tickets to events fees are almost half the price of tickets (glares at ticketmaster). Anywhoodles, so yeah, your final price might be more by the time you get to checkout. Tickets will be available for purchase on event night at the door until the event reaches capacity.</b>

  <summary><i>can I use this [insert word] type of ID?</i></summary>
  <b>We can only accept UNEXPIRED GOVERNMENT issued IDs or Driver's Licenses. I mean, personally, I think, in fact I'm pretty sure you are still YOU when your ID slash license expires. BUT, "the man" sez we can only use UNEXPIRED IDs. Because once it's expired, you, well not you, but some heathen might sell their ID to a minor so they can drink. I mean really? you think a minor is going to use an ID to drink when there are dispensaries?</b>

  <summary><i>what's your refund policy on tickets</i></summary>
  <b>ALL SALES ARE FINAL* Only cancelled performances will be refunded. Refunds will go back to the original card used for purchase within 10 business days from the date of cancellation. This really depends on your bank, it sucks that banks take your cash the instant you swipe, but a refund takes a few days, depending on â€¦ I actually have no fucking clue why sometimes you can get it back in 2 days and other times it takes 2 weeks. so, that's why we say 10 business days</b>

  <summary><i>What's your privacy policy?</i></summary>
  <b>Is anything really private anymore? We livestream events, for that sweet sweet monetization ads on youtube, twitch and kick. only because we have-- hang on, I'm being told we don't have it in place, but we will, at some point in the near future, have a livestream. for 2 reasons, 1 in case someone catches a case, we can prove it wasn't our fault. 2 we're going to have a bounty system, where livestream watchers can catch an employee stealing and get $50. Buuuut, since the livestream setup isn't complete (that's not my department, I just do the copy and the website) we'll eventually have it. so we're putting it in now in case someone forgets to tell me we're livestreaming and this doesn't get updated</b>
